# 🦷 **Evaluation of Stiffness-Matched NiTi Fixation Plates for Mandibular Reconstruction**

---

## 📜 **Summary**

This project explores the improvement of **mandibular reconstruction surgery** by proposing the use of **stiffness-matched, porous NiTi fixation plates** instead of the traditional **Ti-6Al-4V plates**. Conventional Ti-6Al-4V plates lead to **stress shielding** due to their high stiffness, increasing the risk of implant failure. **NiTi**, with its **super-elastic properties** and **lower stiffness**, is a promising alternative to mitigate these risks. 

Using **finite element simulations**, different mandibular models were tested under various **bite forces** and **healing conditions**. Additionally, the feasibility of fabricating these plates through **selective laser melting** was evaluated.

## 🎯 **Objective**
> To evaluate stiffness-matched NiTi fixation plates as a solution to reduce implant failure in mandibular reconstruction.
