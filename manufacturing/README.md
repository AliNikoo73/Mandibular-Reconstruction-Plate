## Manufacturing Methods

### Selective Laser Melting (SLM)

The primary manufacturing method for porous NiTi plates is Selective Laser Melting. Critical parameters include:
- Laser power
- Scan speed
- Hatch spacing
- Layer thickness
- Powder characteristics

### Quality Control

Quality control protocols include:
- Dimensional accuracy verification
- Mechanical testing
- Surface roughness measurement
- Porosity analysis
- Biocompatibility testing

## Equipment

- EOS M 290 (SLM machine)
- Keyence VHX-7000 (Digital microscope)
- Instron 5969 (Mechanical testing)
- GOM ATOS (3D scanning)

## Process Guidelines

1. Follow established parameter sets for specific porosity levels
2. Maintain build chamber conditions within specified ranges
3. Document all build parameters for each manufacturing run
4. Perform post-processing according to provided protocols
5. Complete QC checklist before releasing parts for clinical testing
